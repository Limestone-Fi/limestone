## Invariant Violations
### GLOBAL-01
Classification: ⚠️ (testing suite related)
#### Issue
Due to the dynamics of how share price based (vault-like) assets work, there can be some minor deviations in the exact amounts that are recorded. Based on our findings, this is a non-issue and relates to how our testing suite is setup.
Differences in amounts only tend to be in the realm of a ~1000 wei difference, which for assets such as WETH, AERO, etc, would only be `0.0000000000000001`, or for assets with lower decimals such as USDC, the difference is only about `0.001` or less.
#### Solution
Modify testing suite to calculate a difference between the values and set a specific tolerance threshold to check against in the tests.
### GLOBAL-02
Classification: ⚠️ (testing suite related)
#### Issue
Same as the issue in `GLOBAL-01`.
#### Solution
Solution for ``GLOBAL-01`` is the optimal solution.
### DIVEST-02
Classification: ❌ (issue present)
#### Issue
Due to the way divestment handles removing global debt shares at the start of the call to `PositionCoordinator`, the amount specified for repayment may be different than the actual value repaid. Due to this, the shares removed could exceed the amount we actually repaid in the call to the worker itself. This also *may* run the issue of being able to repay more assets than present from the withdrawal (especially with how the worker itself handles it by repaying with as many tokens as it has available from removing liquidity).
#### Solution
Instead of removing global shares at the start, use a calculated amount of shares removed from the worker itself (delta between the debt shares before repaying and after) and use it for removing the debt shares and debt value from the lending pool's global values. Fixed implementation at commit [`b17df2a1513a2f89c334e048338bd0edd5bdb04a`](https://github.com/Limestone-Fi/limestone/commit/b17df2a1513a2f89c334e048338bd0edd5bdb04a):
```
        // Calculate debt share differences and use them to remove any accounted debt shares if needed.
        stack.debt0Delta = FixedPointMathLib.dist(pos.debtShare0, stack.newDebt0);
        stack.debt1Delta = FixedPointMathLib.dist(pos.debtShare1, stack.newDebt1);
        if (stack.debt0Delta > 0) _ctx.worker._decreaseDelegatedDebtByShares(pos.debt0PoolId, stack.debt0Delta.u112());
        if (stack.debt1Delta > 0) _ctx.worker._decreaseDelegatedDebtByShares(pos.debt1PoolId, stack.debt1Delta.u112());
```
